# 🚑 Ambulance Dispatch Routing Algorithms

This project simulates an emergency ambulance dispatch system using two classic graph search algorithms: **Dijkstra's** and **A\***. It models a road network as a weighted graph and calculates the most efficient route from a hospital to multiple emergency locations to optimize response times.
